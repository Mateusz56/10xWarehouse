### 4. Data Management
✅ **MET**

**Findings:**

  - Entity Framework Core with `WarehouseDbContext`
  - Comprehensive database models in `Db/Models/`:
    - Organization, OrganizationMember, Invitation
    - Warehouse, Location
    - ProductTemplate, Inventory, StockMovement
  - Multiple database migrations:
    - `20251009091337_InitialCreate.cs`
    - `20251015135442_AddCreatedAt.cs`
    - `20251015150614_AddStockMovementsMoveAddAndMoveSubtract.cs`

- **CRUD Operations:**
  - **Backend:** Full REST API with controllers:
    - `OrganizationsController` - Organization CRUD
    - `WarehousesController` - Warehouse CRUD
    - `LocationsController` - Location CRUD
    - `ProductTemplatesController` - Product CRUD
    - `InventoryController` - Inventory queries
    - `StockMovementsController` - Stock movement CRUD
    - `InvitationsController` - Invitation management
    - `UsersController` - User management

  - **Frontend:** State management with Pinia stores:
    - Auth store
    - Organization store
    - Warehouse store
    - Product store
    - Inventory store
    - Stock movements store

**Status:** Complete data management system with database models, migrations, full CRUD operations via REST API, and frontend state management. Multi-tenant data isolation implemented through organization scoping.

---

### 5. Business Logic
✅ **MET**

**Findings:**
- **Stock Movement Operations:**
  - Complex business logic in `StockMovementService.cs`:
    - **Add Stock:** Adds quantity to inventory, creates audit record
    - **Withdraw Stock:** Validates sufficient inventory, subtracts quantity, prevents negative values
    - **Move Stock:** Transfers between locations with dual record creation (MoveSubtract + MoveAdd)
    - **Reconcile Stock:** Sets inventory to specific quantity, calculates delta for audit
  - Transaction-based operations ensuring data consistency
  - Business rule validation (sufficient inventory checks, location validation)

- **Inventory Management:**
  - `InventoryService.cs` for inventory summaries and queries
  - Low-stock threshold checking and alerts
  - Multi-location inventory tracking
  - Automatic inventory record creation when needed

- **Organization & Member Management:**
  - Role-based access control (Owner, Member, Viewer)
  - Invitation system with acceptance workflow
  - Multi-tenant data isolation enforced at service layer
  - User management integration with Supabase

- **Authorization Policies:**
  - `DatabaseRoleAuthorizationHandler.cs` for role-based authorization
  - OwnerOnly, OwnerOrMember, OrganizationMember policies
  - Authorization middleware protecting endpoints based on user roles

- **Dashboard Logic:**
  - Recent activity tracking
  - Low-stock alerts aggregation
  - Dashboard DTOs for aggregated data

**Status:** Sophisticated business logic beyond basic CRUD. Complex inventory operations with transaction safety, role-based access control, multi-tenant isolation, and comprehensive audit trails. The stock movement system demonstrates sophisticated state management and business rule enforcement.
